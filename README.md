# Student Engagement and Performance Analysis

## Project Overview

The project aims to analyze demographic and performance data of students on an online educational platform to understand registration, behavior, and academic outcomes, and to identify trends and areas for improvement.

## Dataset Description

The data includes demographic information (country, age, gender, educational level), course registration numbers, and academic performance metrics, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of success factors.

## Key Findings

- **Low engagement:** Only 4.5% of students complete certificates after viewing courses.
- **Global reach:** The United States and India lead in student numbers.
- **Age group:** Most students are in their twenties and thirties.
- **Gender imbalance:** Males 74.2% vs. females 25%.
- **Performance trends:** Master's and PhD holders outperform bachelor's or secondary education holders.
- **Broad access:** Majority of students are from intermediate educational levels (bachelor's or secondary).

## Suggestions for Improvement

- **Addressing gender balance:** Study course appeal and target females.
- **Supporting lower levels:** Provide introductory materials for students with secondary education.
- **Geographic analysis:** Develop courses aligned with local economies or key industries in each region.
